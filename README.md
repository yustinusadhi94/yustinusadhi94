- Hi, I'm Adhi. I'm from Indonesia. 
- Currently interested in Backend Engineering. 
- Still learning go-lang, python, and typescript.
- Hobbies are watching movies, gaming (not too much recently), read mangas and doing some workout at night.
- Hopefully will try to fill my repositories with something decent.
- よろしく!
